Prep:
------
1. Get inner wall segments
2. Calculate distance (perpendicular) of a point from a line
3. Get inner wall segments of a room (Living) 
4. Get all FWS of a room (Living) below the given elevation (7' : door height)
5. Get free inner wall segments of a room with length >= 3'

6. Place furniture parallel to the wall
7. Get quadrant info
8. Get wall angles
9. Check for intersection with all furns/fixtures/walls
10. Check orientation
11. Get set of wall segments parallel to given line segment
12. Find distance between two parallel line segments
13. Calculate the snap co-ordinates
14. Calculate the co-ordinates of real furnitures
15. Placement of real furnitures from catalog

Code
----
A. Get all FWS in room (Living)
B. Placement of PCSRect
C. Snap to the nearest wall
D. Place all configs of PCS Rects
E. Placement of real furnitures
F. Pathway

Demo
-----
1. All PCS configs
2. Save valid designs in different SH3D files
3. Final - w/o corner table

Issues
------
1. All placements are not snapping to walls - Fixed
2. Orientation inverted in config - Fixed
3. Placement with Accessibility box - Done
4. Change PCS configs for maintaining accessibility - Fixed
5. Increase the length of PCS rect to expand it till the back wall rather than snapping
6. Corner table placement
