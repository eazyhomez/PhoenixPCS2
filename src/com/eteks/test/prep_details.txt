Tuning:
-------
1. Get Relevant Walls for Shift
2. Check for duplicate design and ignore invalid config
3. On inward shift check depth >= 10 ft
4. Placement position shift = 12ft // xxx - 50 ft 
5. Remove duplicates
6. Add priority screening - 2 walls, 1 wall
7. Renaming of files as per priority
8. Place Media Cabinet @ center of its touching wall 

Modifications:
--------------
1. Add Accessibility boxes for doors
2. Add Accessibility boxes for windows and wall openings
3. Do not consider windows, balcony doors and wall opening for FWS
4. Place media cabinet place-holder in PCS
5. Shift and Snap
6. Config (Shift)
7. Bigger seating against the wall
8. Check designs - new PCS layouts with beta shift
9. Check designs - new PCS layouts WITHOUT beta shift


A. Correct the configs
B. Irrespective of room size follow seating order 5,6,7 seater; if less than 3 designs : try 4,8 seater
C. Check Snap - without valid config check
D. Check Snap - with valid config check
E. Calculate PCSRect initial position with 12' shifts in both directions
F. Check Shift - only alpha (outward + inward)
G. Accessibility Line
H. Multiple Accessibility boxes for balcony and wall openings - WIP

Prep:
------
1. Get inner wall segments
2. Calculate distance (perpendicular) of a point from a line
3. Get inner wall segments of a room (Living) 
4. Get all FWS of a room (Living) below the given elevation (7' : door height)
5. Get free inner wall segments of a room with length >= 3'

6. Place furniture parallel to the wall
7. Get quadrant info
8. Get wall angles
9. Check for intersection with all furns/fixtures/walls
10. Check orientation
11. Get set of wall segments parallel to given line segment
12. Find distance between two parallel line segments
13. Calculate the snap co-ordinates
14. Calculate the co-ordinates of real furnitures
15. Placement of real furnitures from catalog

Code
----
A. Get all FWS in room (Living)
B. Placement of PCSRect
C. Snap to the nearest wall
D. Place all configs of PCS Rects
E. Placement of real furnitures
F. Pathway

Demo
-----
1. All PCS configs
2. Save valid designs in different SH3D files
3. Final - w/o corner table

Issues
------
1. All placements are not snapping to walls - Fixed
2. Orientation inverted in config - Fixed
3. Placement with Accessibility box - Done
4. Change PCS configs for maintaining accessibility - Fixed
5. Increase the length of PCS rect to expand it till the back wall rather than snapping
6. Corner table placement
